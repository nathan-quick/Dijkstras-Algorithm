# Final Project - Dijkstra's Algorithm 
1. This project is using Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path among any length of nodes in a graph. We decided to choose 9 different vertices starting from 0 to 8. The purpose of this program is to find the shortest distance from vertex 0 being the starting point and to other vertices 1-8.
2. For example, the shortest distance path between 0 and 8 vertices is 0 → 1 → 2 → 8, and the actual distance would be 14 since the distance from 0 → 1 = 4 (0,1,4), 1 → 2 = 8 (1,2,8), 2 → 8 = 2 (2,8,2) according to addEdge functions, therefore, 4 + 8 + 2 = 14. 
3. We wanted to do a project that uses something that we have learned before such as graphs data structure, and Dijkstra's algorithm was something that seemed interesting to learn and implement with our project.
4. The data structure we chose is graphs because it is the best representation of applying Dijkstra's algorithm.
5. We used Dijkstra's algorithm because it is the algorithm to find the shortest distance between certain pair of vertices.
